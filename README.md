# E-commerce Back End

## Description

Given an e-commerce site's inventory organization instructions, I was able to set up Models and routes using Sequelize and Express.js in irder to develop the back end of the site.

This was an interesting exercise in leveraging Object-Relational Mapping to streamline the interaction between server and database.

## Installation

Clone the repo, then from the command line, run `npm install` in the project's root directory to download any dependencies.

## Usage

The demo video can be found [here]().

Navigate to project root directory and run the command `npm start` to start the server. You will then be able to send various requests to the server to view, add, update and remove data from the database.

For example, if testing from the localHost, sent a GET request to the endpoint http://localhost:3001/api/products/ to retrieve all products. Each product will appear in the response with the asociated cateogry and tags.
